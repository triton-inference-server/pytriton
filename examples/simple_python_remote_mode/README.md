# Simple python remote mode example models

## Overview

The example presents a simple python example of remote mode setup (one model is local and two are remote, setup
from separate python scripts).


Example consists of following scripts:

server_remote_mul.py
server_remote_power.py
server_starting_triton.py

- `install.sh` - install additional dependencies
- `server_starting_triton.py` - start the model locally in Triton Inference Server
- `server_remote_mul.py` - start the model remotely in Triton Inference Server
- `server_remote_power.py` - start the other model remotely in Triton Inference Server
- `client.py` - execute HTTP/gRPC requests to the deployed model

## Quick Start

The step-by-step guide:

1. Install NVIDIA PyTriton following the [installation instruction](../../README.md#installation)
2. Install the additional packages using `install.sh`

```shell
./install.sh
```

3. Set the access token environment variable that will be used for authentication between the Triton server and remote models:

```shell
export TRITON_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-secret-token-here"
```

Note: Use the same access token value in all terminals where you'll run the server scripts. This token ensures secure communication between the main Triton server and the remote models.

4. In separate terminals (make sure to set the same `TRITON_ACCESS_TOKEN` in each terminal) first start triton server using `server_starting_triton.py` and then start
remote models using `server_remote_mul.py` and `server_remote_power.py`:

```shell
./server_starting_triton.py
```

```shell
./server_remote_mul.py
```

```shell
./server_remote_power.py
```

5. Open new terminal tab (ex. `Ctrl + T` on Ubuntu) or window
6. Go to the example directory
7. Run the `client.py` to perform queries on model:

```shell
./client.py
```
