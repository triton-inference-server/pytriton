# Multi-Model Deployment of Python Model

## Overview

The example presents a deployment of multiple Python models at the same time.

Example consists of following scripts:

- `install.sh` - install additional dependencies
- `server.py` - start the model with Triton Inference Server
- `client.py` - execute HTTP/gRPC requests to the deployed model

## Quick Start

The step-by-step guide:

1. Install PyTriton following
   the [installation instruction](../../README.md#installation)
2. Install the additional packages using `install.sh`

```shell
./install.sh
```

3. In current terminal start the model on Triton using `server.py`

```shell
./server.py
```

4. Open new terminal tab (ex. `Ctrl + T` on Ubuntu) or window
5. Go to the example directory
6. Run the `client.py` to perform queries on model:

```shell
./client.py
```
