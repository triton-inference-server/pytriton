# Changelog

## 0.7.0 (2025-08-08)

### Added

- Token-based access restriction for endpoints
- Deployment guide with security best practices

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- By default, `shared-memory`, `model-repository`, `statistics`, `trace`, and `logging` endpoints now require access token
- To restore previous unrestricted behavior, use: `Triton(security_config=TritonSecurityConfig(restricted_endpoints=[]))`

- Fix: Experimental client for decoupled models prevents sending another request, when responses from previous request are not consumed, blocks close until stream is stopped.
- Fix: Leak of ModelClient during Triton creation
- Fix: Fixed non-declared project dependencies (removed from use in code or added to package dependencies)

## 0.4.0 (2023-10-20)

- New: Remote Mode - PyTriton can be used to connect to a remote Triton Inference Server
  - Introduced RemoteTriton class which can be used to connect to a remote Triton Inference Server
    running on the same machine, by passing triton url.
  - Changed Triton lifecycle - now the Triton Inference Server is started while entering the context.
    This allows to load models dynamically to the running server while calling the bind method.
    It is still allowed to create Triton instance without entering the context and bind models before starting
    the server (in this case the models are lazy loaded when calling run or serve method like it worked before).
  - In RemoteTriton class, calling __enter__ or connect method connects to triton server, so we can safely load models
    while binding inference functions (if RemoteTriton is used without context manager, models are lazy loaded
    when calling connect or serve method).
- Change: `@batch` decorator raises a `ValueError` if any of the outputs have a different batch size than expected.
- fix: gevent resources leak in ``FuturesModelClient``

- Fix: Addressed potential instability in shared memory management.
